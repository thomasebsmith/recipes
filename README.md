# Recipes
**Recipes** is a recipe book web server. It is written in Rust using Axum and
SQLx.

It was originally created by Thomas Smith.

## Prerequisites

- sqlite3 (to initialize the database)

## Quick Start
```sh
$ sqlite3 /tmp/recipes.db < setup/create_tables.sql
$ cargo run resources/sample-config.toml
# A server will listen on localhost port 8000 until it's killed
# Log messages will go to /tmp/recipes.log
```
